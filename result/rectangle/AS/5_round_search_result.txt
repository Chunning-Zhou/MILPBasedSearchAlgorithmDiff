search process:
initialized: upperbound = max(6, 6) = 6.
initialized: LB_empty
[1 2 3 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
[ 2  4  6  8 10  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 3  6  9 12 15  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
From all of above, we obtain an optimal objective value:6.
time is 11 s.
